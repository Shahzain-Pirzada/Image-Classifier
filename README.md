🛠️ Installation Guide

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

This will copy the repository to your local machine.


---

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

python -m venv venv

Activate it:

Linux/macOS:


source venv/bin/activate

Windows:


venv\Scripts\activate

> Using a virtual environment ensures your project dependencies are isolated.




---

Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

pip install ultralytics

Other optional packages:

pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib

> ⚠️ Ensure Python >= 3.8 is installed




---

Step 4: Download YOLOv8 Classification Model

The script uses YOLOv8n (nano model) by default:

from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO("yolov8n-cls.pt")

n = nano (fastest and smallest)

For higher accuracy, switch to yolov8m-cls or yolov8l-cls



---

🖥️ Usage Instructions

Basic Example

from yolo_image_classifier import classify_image

image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
predictions = classify_image(image_path, topk=5)

print(f"Image: {image_path}")
for rank, (label, score) in enumerate(predictions, start=1):
    print(f"Top {rank}: {label} ({score:.3f})")


---

Parameters

image_path: Path to the image you want to classify

topk: Number of top predictions to return (1–5 recommended)



---

Sample Output

Image: example.jpg
Top 1: Dog (0.987)
Top 2: Wolf (0.012)
Top 3: Fox (0.001)


---

Batch Prediction

import os
from yolo_image_classifier import classify_image

folder_path = "images/"
for img_file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if img_file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg')):
        full_path = os.path.join(folder_path, img_file)
        predictions = classify_image(full_path, topk=3)
        print(f"Image: {full_path}")
        for rank, (label, score) in enumerate(predictions, start=1):
            print(f"Top {rank}: {label} ({score:.3f})")

> Great for processing large sets of images automatically.




---

Customizing the Model

Replace "yolov8n-cls.pt" with any YOLOv8 classification model for better accuracy or speed.

Adjust topk to get more or fewer predictions.

Modify the code to return probabilities as JSON for API integration.

💡 Tips and Tricks

1. Ensure images are clear and well-lit for best predictions.


2. Use batch mode for multiple images.


3. For high-resolution images, resizing may improve speed.


4. Combine this with object detection models for advanced workflows.


5. Always check model predictions; YOLOv8 is fast but may make mistakes.


6. Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.


7. Use .lower() on labels to avoid case sensitivity issues.


8. Use matplotlib to plot predictions with confidence bars.

📝 Troubleshooting

Error: Model not found

✅ Ensure yolov8n-cls.pt is downloaded and path is correct


Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ultralytics'

✅ Run pip install ultralytics


Slow prediction

✅ Use smaller images or the nano model (yolov8n)


Top-k > 5 warning

✅ Limit topk to 5, or implement manual sorting for larger k




---

📈 Performance

Nano model: fastest, smallest (good for testing)

Medium/Large models: slower but more accurate

GPU usage improves speed significantly
